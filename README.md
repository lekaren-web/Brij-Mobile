## Make sure XCODE locally is version 13


## Current versions
 "react": "^18.0.0",
 "react-native": "^0.68.1",
 Xcode is newly updated from appstore as version 13.3.1
 
 
## Tech stack: 

* React Native 
* ## MUST use XCODE and not Expo (this is for tesitng/launching)
* Database is AWS Amplify (dynamodb)


## Note: 

1. Due to short project timeframe code base needs cleaning up, 
   a. create utils for components
   b. create variables for css styles
   c. uncomment the database code to allow connection to the database again for profile (profile pages for hard coded for potential demoing reasons)

2. Create post, messaging, commenting and likes database table
